# Introduction to x86 and Reverse Engineering

This repo contains all the materials used in my presentation.

Folder layout:

- Slides are in the `presentation` folder (or available online [here](http://g.whatthedude.com/x86-reveng-pres/presentation/#/))
- CMU's Binary Bomb lab is in the `cmu` folder, along with solutions and the dump to be used for reverse engineering
- Some test programs to be used to demonstrate some concepts from the slides are in the `prog` folder
- `gdb-setup.lisp` is an Emacs Lisp function I use to setup GDB within Emacs in a window layout I like. [(Screenshot here)](https://i.imgur.com/k5b9MiT.png)
